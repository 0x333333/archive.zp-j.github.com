It's the most happiest memory for my 3-month internship in Lyon. It has been long long time that I haven't felt so open and comfortable.

We started from Centre Berthelot and walked along the river Rhône, taking about her experience in US, the culture difference, her Paris tour, and something about her family. The river is half blue and half green, without a tiny rubbish. The wind is gentle and I found her is so beautiful.

Around the Skatepark de Guillotière, we watched those guys playing bicycle and roller skating, that's really amazing! Although I have watched that for million times, yestoday it was quite different. The sun felled down, giving us soft sunshine and a pure blue sky.

After that, we went to the playground Bellecour, well, personally, it is not like what her name describes. Belle is far more than beautiful, it means elegant, charming and sort of mysterious. By passing Bellecour, we arrived ONLYLYON, the symbol of lyon. I took some pics for her. We came across a little boy, he took the place of “O”, where I thought could be a good idea to take a photo.

Along the rode of St-Jean, we entered the old town of Lyon. There were a lot of bistros and restos. Before the Musée Miniature et Cinéma, we were shocked by those tiny miniature, they were really cute!

Notre-Dame is at the top of hill, along those small ladders, we stared the climbing. 
From the top, all the Lyon is inside your view.
