Welcome to visit my first blog in Github!

With the help of [GitHub](http://github.com), [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), [Hover](http://hover.com) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), jesusjzp.github.com is now up and running!

This project has been my first use of [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and the [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) template language and so far everything has been very straightforward.

[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) made it super easy to choose a [theme](http://themes.jekyllbootstrap.com) and checkout a copy of the code to my [personal GitHub page](https://github.com/dsposito/dsposito.github.com).

A few [commands](http://www.iterm2.com) later and I'm blogging again for the first time in [years](http://www.xanga.com) and looking forward to sharing my personal and professional experiences, thoughts and projects with the rest of the world.
