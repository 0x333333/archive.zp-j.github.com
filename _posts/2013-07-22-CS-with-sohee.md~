## CouchSurfing with Sohee Kong

It's the most happiest memory for my 3-month internship in Lyon. It has been long long time that I havn't  felt so open and comfortable.

We started from Centre Berthelot and walked along the river Rhône, taking about her experience in US, the culture difference, her paris tour, and something about her family. The river is half blue and half green, without a tiny rubbish. The wind is gentle and I found her is beautifully.

Around the Skatepark de Guillotière, we watched those guys playing bicycle and roller skating, that's really amazing! Although I have watched that for million times, but yestoday it was quite different.
